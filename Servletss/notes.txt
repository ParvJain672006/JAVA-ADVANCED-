a) All the java appli or project follow the MVC architecture (model view controller).

b) Now for model we have – Java Beans. They are like a class, which contain inbuilt getter, setter methods.

Ek object create hota hai (in the form of a bean).

Some app pure database ke andar store kar sakte hai.
